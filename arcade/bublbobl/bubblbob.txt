ROM images for Taito's Bubble Bobble (c)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

All ROMs on my board are 27256 except for a78_05.bin (a 27512) and the color
PROM (7611/82s129)

WARNING! A78_07.BIN is from the old set that was missing A78_20.BIN as mine
was bad. Whether A78_20.BIN is 100% common between the two revisions is
unknown. If you know, please contact me.

Board notes

Two board sandwich (CPU & video). The CPU PCB uses a three Z80s.

The first one is for sound and uses A78_07.BIN. Other sound circuitry include
a YM-2203, YM-3528 and (2) YM3014s.

The remaining CPUs use A78_05, A78_06, A78_07 and a 2016. There is a custom
Taito IC labeled JPH1011P with a cute little logo of our favorite dino :)

The video PCB uses (4) 2018 RAMs and a trio of ceramic encased SIP ICs of an
unknown nature.

Legal stuff - These images were taken from the board that I own to aid in
the troubleshooting and repair of other legal owners. Any other use is at
your own risk. These images are *NOT* to be included in any emulator release.
Doing so would incur the anger of the copyright holders.
