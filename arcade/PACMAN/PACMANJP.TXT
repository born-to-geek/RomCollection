              PACMAN - NAMCO ORIGINAL ( ? )

These roms are taken from what appears to be an original Namco PCB that I
own. The PCB looks the same as that depicted in the scan contained in Namco
classics volume 1 (JAP) for the playstation - apart from a small satelite board
adjacent to the character roms. It isn't clear, but this board may have been
removed for the photograph. There are no NAMCO markings on my board - but
neither does there appear to be on the scan. The serial No. 22021017 is 
etched on the PCB just behind the edge connector.  All roms are marked with
a neat non-pirate looking label marked PM1 and then CHGx or PRGx for the
appropriate roms. The only other interesting IC is an 'NVC285'.

The rom layout is as follows:

                          PRG
               CHR         8
                           6        E
                4          4        D
                2          2        G
                3          7        E
                1          5
                           3
                           1

Okay, that's the boring bit over with. Now the interesting part.

Looking at the Japanese version of Namco classics volume 1, the ghost names
are as follows:

 Character  / Nickname

 OIKAKE       AKABEI
 MACHIBUSE    PINKY
 KIMAGURE     AOSUKE
 OTOBOKE      GUZUTA

These are the correct japanese names - changed for the Western market.

Now, my PCB comes up with the following names:

 URCHIN        MACKY
 ROMP          MICKY
 STYLIST       MUCKY
 CRYBABY       MOCKY

These do not look particularly original to me. However, the correct (JAP) names
are actually contained within the ROMS. Also, when running a .rat file I made
for sparcade, the correct JAPANESE names appear !  Yippee !!!
( The dips do not change the names - but I understand that there was a 
jumper on the board that set the different names ).

Anyway, the PCB APPEARS to be original with just some doubt about the
western names - but these may be correct. Anyone with any info, please let
me know !!!!

These roms are for use by those who own the original PCB.

Cheers
