Here is the ROM set for Q-BERT.

NEVER include these, or ANY ROMs with the existing emulators. The emulator
authors work extremly hard on their emulators, and don't need any
problems, such as roms included with the emulators.

You use these ROMs at your own risk. I assume NO liability for what they
do to your system. Additionaly, you should ONLY use these roms if you are
legally entitled to do so.
